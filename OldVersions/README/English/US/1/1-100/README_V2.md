SNU BrowserNose is a browser sniffing library that aims to achieve compatibility on all web browsers through replacement of features. It is designed to work on all browsers, all the way down to WWW/Nexus 0.1.

# About

SNU BrowserNose is a library of scripts that are designed to make SNU and its distributions compatible with every web browser. Features are replaced or removed, depending on the compliance of the browser. This has to be done, as there are lots of browsers that don't comply with the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) for example: Google Chrome/Google Chromium, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.

# Browser support

# Name meaning

BrowserNose is named the way it is because the action it does is called Browser sniffing. Since the nose sniffs, I treat BrowserNose as the nose of the website to sniff browsers.

## Official nicknames

On Tuesday, June 2nd 2020, Vern (my grandpa) came up with 2 unique variations of the name that I have decided to make the official nicknames:

> `BrowserKnows`

> `BrowserNoseKnows` or `BrowserNose Knows`
