# About

SNU BrowserNose is a library of scripts that are designed to make SNU and its distributions compatible with every web browser. Features are replaced or removed, depending on the compliance of the browser. This has to be done, as there are lots of browsers that don't comply with the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) for example: Google Chrome/Google Chromium, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.
