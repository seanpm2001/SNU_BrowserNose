## M3V7_PreAlpha1.0B

### About

This release is a followup to the release made for archiving 2 years of no development. This release is coming 1 day late (on 2022 Monday March 7th) but archives the new state of the project. Nothing has been added in terms of BrowserNose functionality, this was purely a documentation, CI, and archive update.
