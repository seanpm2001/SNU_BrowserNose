# Regarding the End of Life of the UserAgentString

This project was built on the functionality of user agent strings, and browser sniffing. Newer browsers are now aiming to get rid of UAStrings which would jeopardize this project, notably Mozilla Firefox 100.0 and Google Chrome 100.0.

There are a lot of bad actors who abuse the user agent string to track/fingerprint users, or restrict them from using their website. There are also good actors too, but they don't seem to be as commonly talked about.

I might be able to find some other way, but there are still tens of thousands of versions of web browsers that support UAStrings and can be worked with, but they will slowly go more and more unused, until they are Virtual Machine only and don't work with modern websites.

It is a bit sad that this set of projects may be obsoleted, there should be a new way of doing things. Browser sniffing may just not be the way to go, regardless of if you have good intentions or not

This affects the following projects of mine:
