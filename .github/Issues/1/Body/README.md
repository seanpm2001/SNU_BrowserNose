### The major expansion - December 2nd 2020

I was relaxing this morning/early sunrise period by reading r/programmerhumor and other subreddits, and I came across a joke related to web development, which is the insane amount of browsers and devices needing to be supported. It went so much further than I expected, I completely overlooked things like the Nintendo 3DS browser. Apparently, this is a legitimate concern for some people. I completely overlooked all gaming console web browsers.

Expanding on this, I found a funny joke about an obscure LeapFrog model not loading an HTML element correctly. I found the joke incredibly comedic at the time, but a few hours later, I realized the nightmare I have inherited. If there are this many obscure browser and device combinations that don't follow WHATWG standards, there are likely thousands (possibly hundreds of thousands) of combinations of browsers and devices that need to be accommodated for.

My idea of an "obese binary" might have gone from a 1 megaton obese binary file to a 1 gigaton of 1 teraton obese binary file. I am going to need time to accommodate this vast selection of browsers and devices without causing severe page delay upon loading. This project just got a lot more difficult.
